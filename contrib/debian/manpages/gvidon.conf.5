.TH GVIDON.CONF "5" "June 2016" "gvidon.conf 0.12"
.SH NAME
gvidon.conf \- Gvidon Core configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
All command-line options (except for '\-conf') may be specified in a configuration file, and all configuration file options may also be specified on the command line. Command-line options override values set in the configuration file.
.TP
The configuration file is a list of 'setting=value' pairs, one per line, with optional comments starting with the '#' character. Please refer to gvidond(1) for a up to date list of valid options.
.TP
The configuration file is not automatically created; you can create it using your favorite plain-text editor. By default, gvidond(1) will look for a file named gvidon.conf(5) in the Gvidon Core data directory, but both the data directory and the configuration file path may be changed using the '\-datadir' and '\-conf' command-line arguments.
.SH LOCATION
gvidon.conf should be located in $HOME/.gvidoncore
