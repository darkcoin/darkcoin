What is Cadex?
----------------

Cadex is a total of dash fork an experimental digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Cadex uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. Cadex coin is the name of the open
source software which enables the use of this currency. We are building a platform for business solutions

SPECIFICATIONS
--------------
Algorithm: x11

Block Reward: 25.16 CADEX, masternode gets 15.017 CADEX of block reward and the rest goes to Miners

RPCPORT: 28280

P2P PORT: 27270


MASTERNODE CONFIGURATIONS
-------------------------
1) Using the control wallet, enter the debug console (Tools > Debug console) and type the following command:
```
masternode genkey (This will be the masternode’s privkey. We’ll use this later…)
```
2) Using the control wallet still, enter the following command:
```
getaccountaddress chooseAnyNameForYourMasternode
```
3) Still in the control wallet, send 100,000 CADEX to the address you generated in step 2 (Be 100% sure that you entered the address correctly. You can verify this when you paste the address into the “Pay To:” field, the label will autopopulate with the name you chose”, also make sure this is exactly 100,000 CADEX; No less, no more.). ###Wait for 15 confirmation before starting the masternode
4) Still in the control wallet, enter the command into the console (This gets the proof of transaction of sending 100,000):
```
masternode outputs
```
5) Still on the main computer, go into the cadex data directory, by default in Windows it’ll be
```
%Appdata%/CADEXCOIN
```
or Linux
```
cd ~/.CADEXCOIN
```
Find masternode.conf and add the following line to it:
```
# Format: alias IP:port masternodeprivkey collateral_output_txid collateral_output_index
```
or follow here
```
<Name of Masternode(Use the name you entered earlier for simplicity)> <Unique IP address>:51472 <The result of Step 1> <Result of Step 4> <The number after the long line in Step 4>
```
B. VPS Remote wallet install
----------------------------
1. From your home directory, download the latest version from the CADEX GitHub repository:
```
wget https://github.com/cadexproject/cadex/releases/download/v1.0.0/ubuntu16-cli.tar.gz
```
2. Unzip and extract:  
```
tar -xvf ubuntu16-cli.tar.gz
```
3. Go to your cadexcoin directory:
```
cd ubuntu16
```
4. Note: If this is the first time running the wallet in the VPS, you’ll need to attempt to start the wallet 
```
./cadexd
```
5. stop cadexd with
```
CTRL+C
```
6. Now on the masternodes, find the CADEX data directory here.(Linux: ~/.CADEXCOIN)
```
cd ~/.CADEXCOIN
```
7. Open the cadex.conf by typing
```
vi cadex.conf or nano cadex.conf 
```
8. Add the below code in the cadex.conf file 
```
 rpcuser=long random username
 rpcpassword=longer random password
 rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
 rpcport=28280
 listen=1
 server=1
 daemon=1
 logtimestamps=1
 maxconnections=80
 masternode=1
 externalip=your vps ip address
 masternodeprivkey=Result of Step 1
```
9. start your vps cadex daemon
```
./cadexd
```
10. Start your masternode from your desktop wallet
```
masternode start-alias MN1
```

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is meant to be stable. Development is normally done in separate branches.
[Tags](https://github.com/cadexproject/cadex/tags) are created to indicate new official,
stable release versions of Dash Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/qa) of the RPC interface, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/qa) are installed) with: `qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Dash Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/cadex/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.
