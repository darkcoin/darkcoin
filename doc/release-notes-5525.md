Governance Changes
------------------------

Sentinel will no longer be supported, its logic is integrated into Core.

During the Superblock Maturity Window (1662 blocks), payee Masternodes will try to create, sign and submit a Superblock (GovTrigger).
Once a MN has submitted a GovTrigger, it votes for it and will vote no for any other competing GovTrigger.
