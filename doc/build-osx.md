macOS Build Instructions and Notes
====================================
The commands in this guide should be executed in a Terminal application.
The built-in one is located in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`.

Preparation
-----------
Install the macOS command line tools:

`xcode-select --install`

When the popup appears, click `Install`.

Then install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

Base build dependencies
-----------------------

```bash
brew install automake libtool pkg-config
```

If you want to build the disk image with `make deploy` (.dmg / optional), you need RSVG
```bash
brew install librsvg
```

Building
--------

Follow the instructions in [build-generic](build-generic.md)

Build Bitcoin Core
------------------------

1. Clone the Bitcoin Core source code and cd into `bitcoin`

        git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin
        cd bitcoin

2.  Build Bitcoin Core:

    Configure and build the headless Bitcoin Core binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).

    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.

        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure
        make

3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests:

        make check

4.  You can also create a .dmg that contains the .app bundle (optional):

        make deploy

Running
-------

Dash Core is now available at `./src/dashd`

Before running, it's recommended that you create an RPC configuration file.

    echo -e "rpcuser=dashrpc\nrpcpassword=$(xxd -l 16 -p /dev/urandom)" > "/Users/${USER}/Library/Application Support/DashCore/dash.conf"

    chmod 600 "/Users/${USER}/Library/Application Support/DashCore/dash.conf"

The first time you run dashd, it will start downloading the blockchain. This process could take several hours.

You can monitor the download process by looking at the debug.log file:

    tail -f $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/DashCore/debug.log

Other commands:
-------

    ./src/dashd -daemon # Starts the dash daemon.
    ./src/dash-cli --help # Outputs a list of command-line options.
    ./src/dash-cli help # Outputs a list of RPC commands when the daemon is running.

Using Qt Creator as IDE
------------------------
You can use Qt Creator as an IDE, for dash development.
Download and install the community edition of [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/download/).
Uncheck everything except Qt Creator during the installation process.

* Tested on OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion through macOS 10.13 High Sierra on 64-bit Intel processors only.
